# 🔐 Secure Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ GitHub Push Issue Fixed!

Your code is now successfully pushed to GitHub without exposing sensitive API keys.

## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel (Secure Method)

### Step 1: Deploy from GitHub

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository: `DineshKarthikeyan1/sem5-group-project`
4. Set root directory to: `voice-assisted-financial-manager`

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard

In the Vercel project settings, add these environment variables:

```
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY = [Your Groq API Key]
VITE_SUPABASE_URL = [Your Supabase URL]
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = [Your Supabase Anonymous Key]
VITE_SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD = [Your Supabase Database Password]
```

**Note**: Use the actual values from your `.env` file when setting up in Vercel dashboard.

### Step 3: Deploy

Click "Deploy" and your app will be live!

## 🔍 Why the Blank Page Issue?

The blank page on Vercel was likely because:

1. Environment variables weren't properly set
2. Build errors due to missing dependencies
3. JavaScript errors in production

With the environment variables properly configured in Vercel dashboard, your app should work perfectly!
